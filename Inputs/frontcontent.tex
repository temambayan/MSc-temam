First of all, I thanks to God for His unlimited love, care, and undesirable help He
has done to me throughout my life. I would like to express my deep gratitude
to my advisor and instructor Dr. Remudin Reshid for his continuous guidance and great support. I would like to extend my thanks to my instructors and the department of physics of the Addis Ababa University and its staffs, I have learned many things from them like respecting teaching profession, punctuality, encouraging learners to have creative mind and so on. I would also like to acknowledge the financial support for my studies provided by the Addis Ababa Educational
Bureau. Finally, I am very grateful thanks to my friends Murad Yimam, Debela Alemayehu, Jemal Regassa, Natnael and all my classmates I have received many comments and feed backs.
