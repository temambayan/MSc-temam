\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:5}
In section 3.5.2 ,  the  plots  of  flux  against  time ( light curves ) of  10  GRBs  are  shown  in  fig 3 and  fig 4  respectively. The  light  curves  of  each  sampled  GRBs   were  all  decaying   with   time. However ,  due  to  activity of central  engines (progenitors )  and   interaction  of ejecta  with  circumbrust medium , some light curves  of  x-ray  were   decaying  rapidly  while  the others  slow.This is the  common  behavior  of  x-ray afterglows .
