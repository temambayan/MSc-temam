\chapter{introduction}
Mankind is quite obsessed with explaining our existence, from justifying our nationality to justifying the universe and our place in it. So, while it is certainly difficult to attempt to map the universe because of its size, it is even more difficult to try to explain away matter in the universe that canâ€™t give light, but we know exists. Such matter is called dark matter.Dark matter is matter in the universe that we cannot see directly because it does not emit light. However, we know dark matter exists because of how its gravity affects the other universal bodies, like star and galaxies.
