\section{Introduction}
 
\textbf{what are gamma-ray bursts?}\\
Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are the most powerful explosions in the Universe and, arguably, represent the most significant new astrophysical phenomenon since the discovery of quasars and pulsars or the Big Bang. As their name suggests, GRBs are detected as brief, intense and totally unpredictable flashes of high-energy gamma rays, thought to be happened during the core collapse of super massive stars ( long-soft bursts, $T _{90}$ > 2 seconds ) or the merger of two compact objects such as binary neutron stars or a neutron star and a stellar mass black hole (short-hard bursts, $T _{90}$ < 2 seconds).[7184..]\\ 
They are the fastest extended objects of Nature, that injecting large amount of energy of order $10^{54}$ ergs or $ 10^{47} $ joules from very small compact region in a few seconds at cosmological distance. During explosion ,the energy they released for a few second to hundred seconds comparable to the energy that  the Sun will emit in its entire 10 G years of life time. The overall observed fluence ranges from $10^{-4} $ ergs/$ cm^{2}$ to $ 10^{-7} $ ergs/ $ cm^{2} $  corresponds to the isotropic equivalent luminosity of $ 10^{48} $  to  $10^{54} $ erg $ s^{-1} $ (see fig 1.2 in  section 1.2) \citep{1}.\\\\
Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are at the intersection of many different areas of astrophysics: they are relativistic events connected with the end stages of massive stars; they reveal properties of their surrounding medium and of their host galaxies; they emit radiation from gamma-rays to radio wavelengths, as well as possibly non-electromagnetic signals, such as neutrinos, cosmic rays and gravitational waves. Due to their enormous luminosity, they can be detected even if they occur at vast distances, and are therefore also of great interest for cosmology \citep{2}.\\\\
 During  explosions, ultra relativistic jets are produced accompanied by an intense gamma-ray flashes called prompt emissions that outshine all the sky at very high red shifts.These prompt emissions are often followed by afterglow signals across the electromagnetic spectrum from X-ray to radio wavelengths covering timescales from tenth of seconds up to several months or more \citep{1,2}.\\\\
GRB  events are  classified   as being  either  long  (lasting > 2) or short (lasting < 2 s), separated  by  the length  of duration $T_{90} \sim 2 $sec, and  spectral hardness of their prompt emissions, with long  GRBs (LGRBs) believed to be associated with the  deaths of collapsed  massive  stars, whilst  short  GRBs (SGRBs) more likely to be  the  result of  either  the  merger of  binary  neutron  stars (BNS) or the  merger  of  a neutron  star  with  a black  hole (NS-BH) \citep{3}.\\\\
Due to their huge radiated energies, GRBs can be observed up to $z  \sim 10$, therefore they are very powerful cosmological tools, complementary to other probes such as SN-Ia , clusters etc.The correlation between spectral peak photon energy Ep,i and intensity (Eiso, Liso, Lp,iso) is one of the most robust and intriguing properties of GRBs and a promising tool for measuring cosmological parameters \citep{2, 3}.
\section{Historical Discovery of gamma-Ray bursts }
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) were first discovered unexpectedly during the Cold War
in the late of $1960_{s}$  by the Vela military satellites that  were equipped with detectors of gamma-rays, X-rays and neutrons and launched by USA Air Force in collaboration with the Los Alamos National Laboratory.The first event was recorded in 1967.After verification, it was clear that gamma radiation was not of human origin, nor even terrestrial. However,the existence of Gamma-ray flashes coming from cosmos was  announced the first event after six years in 1973 dating back to july 2,1967 \citep{4}.\\\\ 
The study of GRBs physics mainly led by observations with help of improved detecting instruments on satellites to monitor phenomena in the universe in relation to  Gamma- ray emissions.  Prompted by the instrumental progress from time to time, the story of observational research of GRBs from early time to recent  classified in five eras  \citep{4} \citep { 5}.\\\\
\subsection{Dark era (1967-1990)}
 The first gamma -ray burst discovered  named as " GRB 670702" that  detected by vela satellite (see fig 1.1).In the name " GRB 670702", the first two digits represent the burst year, the middle two  and the last two digits represent month and the last two digits date of the burst. If more than two events of bursts were happened in one day, they labeled to identify them  using  English letters alphabetically. \citep {4} \citep { 5}.\\\\
\begin{center}
\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{Light curve of the first GRB ever detected by Vela. Two separate pulses can be identified over a duration of less than 10 seconds \citep{4}}
\end{figure}
\end{center}
After the first discovery , the series of vela satellites were launched ,and more than 70 GRBs were detected. These earliest observational result of GRBs only consists several structures “spikes” were found in Gamma-ray band ,but no way to identify their location. However,after series of  vela satellites were launched with improved detecting instruments ,the origins of GRBs believed to be out side the solar system by offset information \citep{4} \citep { 5}.\\\\
The fundamental questions of the era were : Where are GRBs come from ?   What is the source of such flashes of light? By what mechanisms ? do they appear in our galaxy, the Milky Way, or in more distant galaxies ? To answer such questions More than one hundred models were proposed to explain the origin and  production mechanisms of GRBs. However, only a few of them were explaining  that GRBs events occur at cosmological (at far distances). On the other hand, the majority of the models were indicating that the events of GRBs closer to the Earth (galactic origin) apparently to overcome the energy out put. During the era, the detection and interpretation of GRBs were not progressive due to lack of improved detecting instruments ,however  GRBs as new field of science was opened at the end of the era\citep{4}\citep{6}. \\\\
\subsection{BATSE era (1991-2000)}
The Burst And Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) was the early advanced space detecting instruments that carried on the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory (CGRO), that capable to map Gamma-ray sources from almost the entire sky in energy range of (20keV - 2MeV ). Between 1991 and 2000, BATSE detected 2704 GRBs, as shown in the diagram below. It can be seen that they are fairly uniformly spread over the entire sky, indicating that they are either nearby and clustered around our position, or they do not originate in our  Galaxy.The contributions of BATSE in its nine years successful operations were:\\
$\bullet$ At its early operation in 1991,the apparent isotropic spatial distributions of 2704 GRBs were confirmed (see fig 1.2 ) ,and then the cosmological origin of GRBs was accepted by astronomers although the debate between galactic and cosmological origin continued until BeppoSAX. \citep{5}\citep{7}.\\\\
The fig below shows that the  distribution is « isotropic »: the bursts are distributed randomly on the map indicating that they are either very close to the Earth, or very far, of extra galactic origin. No concentration of bursts along the plane of the Milky Way, symbolized on the map by the horizontal center line, appears. This most likely excludes candidates from our galaxy.\\\\
\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}
Long duration, bright bursts are shown in red, while shorter, weak bursts appear in purple. The bursts in grey are those for which the fluence could not be calculated, because of incomplete data. (The fluence indicates the total energy passing through a unit area; in X-ray astronomy, the unit of fluence is erg cm-2.)\\
$\bullet$Fireball model as the theoritical tool to explain the huge amount of energy   drived from observed flux and fast time variability.\\
$\bullet$ confirm  the classification GRBs into two types (short and long GRBs) according to  bimodal distribution of duration parameter $ T_{90} $.\\
$\bullet$provide database of GRBs, their spectral and temporal properties \citep{5}\citep{7}.\\\\
\textbf{limitations of BATSE}\\
$\bullet$unable to classify  diversities(single spikey pulses,smooth with or multiple peaks,very erratic,chaotic and spiky).\\ 
$\bullet$ BATSE’s observations remain limited to gamma-rays alone,no follow-up observations at other longer wavelengths \citep{5}\citep{6} \citep{7}.
\subsection{Bepposax era (1997-2000)}
Bepposax equipped with improved instruments on satellite launched in 1997. It was designed to detect long -living afterglows from X-ray to  radio wavelength.In 1997, BeppoSAX detected the first X-ray afterglow within a GRB error box (GRB970228). An optical transient was also found, fading within a week (HST press release). The identification of GRB970228 with a host galaxy at a known distance (red shift of 0.695) confirmed the cosmological origin of GRBs.The contributions of BATSE in its seven years operations were:\\
$\bullet$ confirm the precise location of the burst in the X-rays rapidly transmitted  and also discovered weak and decreasing signals.This was the late-time, weaker emission radiates in the X-rays, optical and radio waves. \\
$\bullet$ Opened a new era for the current understanding  mysteries of GRBs.\\
$\bullet$ predicted the existence of GRBs afterglow in longer energy bands (from optical to radio wave length).\\
$\bullet$Provide clues for GRB-SN possible connection , which was latter confirmed by
HETE-2 and Swift that support collapser model and explosions of massive star
of wolf-Rayet (WR),leaving behind BH.\\
$\bullet$Provide crucial information on the progenitors of GRBs.\\
$\bullet$X-ray flash as new class of GRB with less-lumineous and low redshift identified from traditional GRBs \citep{4} \citep{7}.\\\\
\textbf{limitation of Beppo-sax}\\
$\bullet$ unable to show the canonical behavior of x-ray afterglow which was later revealed by swift \citep{5}.\\\\
\subsection{ Swift era  (2004-now) }
 Swift was a robotic space   satellite that  launched  on November 20, 2004 and become fully  operational in 2005. It has  been designed for  multi-wavelength approach to detect  X-ray, optical and radio bands: called afterglow emissions .  Swift has unique  capability of performing  fast  autonomous  slews to  track the  GRB  and  its  afterglow  with  minimum  delay. Swift aimed  to  investigate four   phenomena : progenitors  of  GRBs , different physical  processes  underlying  different  classes of GRB  observations , the  interaction  between  blast wave  and  its  surroundings  and   early  evolution  of  Universe via  GRBs. Furthermore, swift  aimed  to investigate  non- electromagnetic waves ( GRBs ) related  phenomenae  such  as  neutrions , cosmic ray  and  gravitatinal  waves . In its ten years  operations , Swift  detected  more  than 2300 GRBs \citep{4} \citep{6}. \\\\
The swift's  three instruments on-board - the  Burst Alert Telescope ( BAT ),  X-ray Telescope (XRT) and   Ultraviolet and  Optical Telescope ( UOVT ) -that working together and they  enabled to study  the  prompt and afterglow emissions  over a broad range of wavelengths. (see fig 1.3) The  three  swift instruments and their functions described below:\citep{8}\cite{9}.\\
\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{Schematic view of the swift satellite(Gehrels et.al 2004).The size of Mask of BAT is $2.7m^{2}$  \citep{7}} 
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\textbf{Burst Alert Telescope (BAT)}.\\
BAT detects GRB event and computes its coordinate (position) in the sky and
locates the position of each event with an accuracy of 1 - 4 arcminutes with in 15
seconds. This position immediately relayed to the ground and rapid slew-ground
based telescope catches the informations.\\\\
\textbf{X-Ray Telscope (XRT)}\\
It takes image and perform spectral analysis of the GRB afterglow. It  provides
more precise position of GRB with a typical error circle of approximation 2 arc seconds radius. The XRT also used to perform long term monitoring of GRB afterglow light curves and operated in energy range of 0.2 keV - 10 keV .\\\\
\textbf{ Ultra Violet optical Telescope (UVOT)}\\
UVOT used to detect optical afterglow and provide a sub-arc seconds position. It
also used to provide longer wave length follow ups of GRB afterglow light curves.
 Swift has been a great success in its observations.\\
$\bullet$ Revealed unusual behavior  “canonical" X-ray afterglow  and  X-ray flaring activity during the afterglow phase.\\
$\bullet$ provides the capability to obseve the transition from prompt to afterglow emissions and  detect  the high-z GRBs such as 050904,080913 and 090423,which were the most distant cosmic explosions \citep {5} \citep{7}.\\\\

\subsection{Fermi era (2008-now)}
 Fermi designed to focus on prompt emissions phase of GRBs by using  much higher energy ranges (8keV - 300keV) than swift (15keV -150keV).It carries on board two types of detectors known to be  Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GRBM ) and Large Area Telescope (LAT).They provide unprecedented spectral coverage for seven orders of magnitudes of energy from 8 keV to 300 GeV.Fermi made Significant progresses for the current understanding of origin of GRBs.\\ 	The contributions of Fermi since launched were:\\
$\bullet$ The existence of three elemental spectral components (Band function-like, thermal and extra non-thermal power-law component ) in GRB spectra was confirmed.\\
$\bullet$ Suggest that the featureless Band function spectra extended from keV to Gev band a Poynting-flux-dominated flow.\\
$\bullet$ Explain the existence of thermal components in some GRBs(e.g GRB 5090902B) due to hot fireball without strong magnetization.\\
$\bullet$ The delayed onset of GeV emission in some LAT GRBs suggests that there likely be a change of either particle acceleration condition or the opacity of the fireball during the early prompt emission epoch.\\
$\bullet$ confirms that long lived GeV emission is likely of external origin, while GeV emission during the prompt phase, on the other hand is likely of internal origin \citep{10} \citep{11}.
\section{Classification of gamma-ray bursts}
Based on the bimodal distributions of duration $ T_{90}$ or $ T_{50}$ of prompt phase or hardness ratio , GRBs have been catagorized in to two groups: short/hard and long/soft GRBs. The duration of GRB,$ T_{90} $ or $ T_{50}$  , is defined by the time interval over which 90 \%  or  50 \%  of the burst fluence is detected respectively. The typical duration of a GRBs is $\sim $ 20 - 30  seconds for long bursts and $\sim $ 0.2 - 1.3 seconds for short one. Observational result tells us that the duration of GRBs can be in a range of 5 orders of magnitude, i.e, from $\sim $ $ 10^{-2} $ s  to $\sim $ $ 10^{3} $ s. The bimodal distribution of $ T_{90} $ has been used to identify the two categories of GRBs, namely, “long” or "soft" ($ T_{90}$ $\geqslant $ 2  s ) and “short” or " hard "$( T_{90}$   $\leqslant$ 2 s ) (see Fig1.4 ). Instrumentally ,  $T_{90}$  or  $T_{50} $ depends on the energy band and the sensitivity limit of the detector.
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Figures/fig4.png}
\caption{The GRB classification (long and short) distribution. GRBs last between a few milliseconds and several minutes. There appear to be two populations, 'short' bursts, with duration peaking around 0.3 seconds and 'long' bursts, which last around 30 seconds, with the 'dividing line' between the groups being ~ 2 seconds. }
\end{center}
\end{figure} 
Theoretically, there are three timescales which may be related to the observed GRB duration $ T_{90} $:\\
(1) central engine activity time scale $t_{eng}$\\
(2) relativistic jet launching time scale $t_{jet} $\\
(3) energy dissipation time scale $t_{dis}$ . Then, the observed GRBs with duration $  T_{90}$ should satisfy: \citep{5}
\begin{equation}
T_{90} \leq \delta  t_{dis} \leq\delta t_{jet} \leq \delta t_{eng} 
\end{equation}
\subsection{short/hard gamma-ray bursts} 
Short / Hard  gamma  ray  bursts  (SGRBs)  are  events  with  a duration $T_{90}$ less than 2 seconds  and  account for  about  30\%  of  the total  gamma  ray  bursts. such  out  bursts   are so strong  that  they  produce   ripples in the  fabric of space-time  called   gravitational  waves.  Short  GRBs  were  likely  caused  when  two  ultradense  stellar  corpses   known  as  neutron  stars  collided  and formed a black hole , or  when   a black  hole   ate  a neutron  star.  They  are  highly  energetic / hard   gamma-rays  when  compared  with their  long  burst  counter  parts. For  many years  short-hard  GRBs  were  not  deeply   researched as long  GRBs. As a result, the  study  of short-hard  GRBs (SHBs) limited.  However, one  year  after  swift  launch, in 2005 a breakthrough  occurred  following  the first  detections  of  SHB  afterglows \citep{5}\citep{6}.\\\\
The  swift  observations  established that SHBs are  cosmological relativistic sources  that, unlike long GRBs, do not originate from the collapse of massive stars, and  therefore  constitute  a distinct  physical  phenomenon. One viable  model for SHB  origin  is  the  coalescence  of  compact  binary systems , in which case SHBs are   the  electromagnetic  counterparts of strong  gravitational-wave sources. In this  burst, the  conversion  of  energy  into gamma- rays  decreases  as  the burst progresses. There  is  no  radio,  optical, or  x-ray  counterpart  has  found  for any  short  burst \citep{5}.
\subsection{long/soft gamma-ray bursts}
Another  sub  class  of  GRBs  that  account for 70\%  and  have  a duration  of greater  than 2 seconds  are  classified  as long/soft  GRBs ( see fig 1.4 above ).  All long  bursts  display  x-ray  afterglow  and  about  one-half  as  radio  or  optical  afterglows. In  long  duration  bursts  energy  conversion  appears  to  remain  constant  through  burst. Their  creation  linked  to  a young  galaxies  with  rapid  star  formation  and  to  a core  collapse  of  powerful supernova ( hypenova )  occurred  when  massive stars  collapsed to black hole.This is  unambigeously   associating  long  GRB  with  the  death  of  massive  stars at high red  shift  originated  in  star -forming  regions.  \citep{6}. Hypernovas  are  100  times  brighter  than  typical  supernovas  and  are  thought  to  be  generated  by  stars  that   are   spinning   particularly  fast  or  have  an  especially  strong  magnetic  field,  imparting   extra  energy  to  their  combustions. 
\subsection{Ultra long gamma-ray bursts (ULGRBs)}
GRBs with highly a typical duration of more than 10,000 sec called ultra-long gamma-ray bursts (ulGRBs).They are the tail end of the standard long GRBs that caused by the collapse of a blue supergiant star,tidal disturption events or a new born magnatar. They have been proposed to form a new third class of GRBs. One explanation which has been proposed for their ultra-long duration is that they could have progenitors differ from classical GRBs in that: they could be produced either by the core collapse of a low-metallicity supergiant blue star, the birth of a magnetar following the collapse of a massive star or the collapse of a Pop III star.In any case, it is clear that the duration of these bursts make them so peculiar that they need further studies \citep{10} \citep{11}.
\section{Gilobal properties of GRBs}
Two distinct global properties of “classical GRBs” began to emerge—the intensity /brightness and the angular / location distributions—both are important implications for the distance scale of GRBs and hence their origin.
\subsection{Intensity distribution}
The brightness distribution of GRBs appeared to show that we were seeing out to the edge of the GRB population:there were too few faint GRBs relative to the number expected if GRBs were uniformly (“homogeneously”) distributed in space.
Brightness was most straight forwardly measured as the peak flux (P , with units [erg $ s^{-1} $ $cm^{-2} $ ]) in the light curve of a GRB. The brightness distribution is usually measured as the number, N(>P ), of GRBs brighter than some peak flux P per year. If the peak luminosity (L, with units [erg $ s^{-1} $]) of all GRBs is the same, then, using the $\frac{1}{r^{2}}$ law, for a given flux P we would see all the GRBs within a maximum distance:\citep{7} \citep{12}.
$$
d_{max}\approx\sqrt{\frac{L}{4\pi P}}\varpropto P^{\frac{-1}{2}}
$$
All the GRBs to that distance would be brighter than P by construction. The
number of GRBs we would detect to that brightness (or brighter) in one year would
just be the volume times the intrinsic rate (R, in units of [event $yr^{-1}$ per volume element]):$ N (> P ) \propto V \times R \propto R \times d_{max} \propto R \times P^{\frac{-3}{2}}$.  So with a homogeneous distribution, we expect that the number of faint GRBs N should grow as a power law proportional to $P^{\frac{-3}{2}} $, where the constant of proportionality scales directly related to the intrinsic rate R: for every ten times fainter in flux we observe, we would nominally expect about thirty-two times more GRBs. While this was indeed seen for the brightest events,there was a flattening at the faint end of the brightness distribution. This flattening was highly suggestive that we were seeing the “edge” of the GRB distribution in space,an important clue in understanding the distance scale. But without knowing the intrinsic luminosity L, we could only infer the shape of the distribution, not the scale. It was like seeing a picture of a building but not knowing if it was of a miniature in a snow globe or the life-sized version \citep{7}\citep{12}.\\\\
\subsection{Angular distribution}
The locations of GRBs on the sky appeared to be randomly (isotropically) distributed:
that is, there was no indication that any one direction on the sky was especially
more apt to produce GRBs than any other (see fig1.2 in section 1.1).If GRBs were due to neutron stars strewn through out the disk of the Galaxy, for instance, the locations of GRBs on the sky should have been preferentially located near the Galactic plane (as is seen with SGRs). If associated with older stars in the roughly spherical “bulge” of the Milky Way, GRBs would have been preferentially located in the direction toward the Galactic center and less so toward the opposite direction.
The inference that the Sun was roughly at the center of the GRB distribution in space,while casting aside some models, still allowed for a variety of distance scales: from a fraction of a light year to billions of light years \citep{7}.
\section{Statement of the problems}
As mentioned in section 1.1 above ,to study the mystery and  phenomenology of Gamma-ray bursts , several  satellites ( from Vela at early time  to  Fermi and others at recent time ) equipped  with different instruments (telescopes ) have been launched. Among those satellites , swift was open new era  for the current understanding and development of gamma ray researches.Swift missions  detected  prompt and  afterglow emission phases of gamma-ray burst. Not only this, the  temporal and spectral behaviors ,Light curve  properties of x-ray and optical afterglow of  gamma-ray burst also studied in detailed. However, as far as my search /review literature is concerned, there is  knowledge gaps  explaining more about canonical x-ray afterglow light curves:\\
$\bullet$ Does x-ray afterglow results of internal or external shocks ?  \\
$\bullet$ What parameters / variables responsible for the variations of temporal and spectral indices  of canonical x-ray ;\\
$\bullet$ what is the implications variations both indices.\\
In this thesis, I emphasized on the theoretical and observational properties of canonical X-ray afterglow light curves  qualitatively and quantitatively.\\\\
Regarding this work the unclear ideas or un answered questions are listed below. Among these:\\
(1) what are the cause of canonical x-ray light curve of afterglow gamma-ray bursts?\\
(2) what are the progenitors of canonical x-ray light curves?\\
(3) Did the  value  of temporal index  of any random GRB confirmed to the proposed value in all phases canonical x-ray light curves?\\
(4) Could some of the breaks at  end of the plateau phase actually be jet break or late steep decay phase? The goal of this thesis is  attempt to explain and give answers for these questions.
