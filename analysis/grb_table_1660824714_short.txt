080426	13:23:22	310219	69.469	1.7				BAT: While the T90 value puts this burst in the middle of the long and short burst T90-distribution peaks, the lag value puts this burst in the long burst class.|UVOT: no detection
080121	21:29:55	301491	41.841	0.7				The significance of the source in the detection image was just below the alert threshold, so Swift did not slew immediately to the burst. In addition, the source location was in Moon constraint, so no late observation was made.|XRT: no detection|UVOT: no detection

070923	19:15:23	292004	-38.294	0.05				Swift is in the process of returning to normal operations, automatic slewing to GRBs is currently disabled.  Therefore, there are no prompt XRT or UVOT observations of this burst. This burst is 38 deg from the Sun and so is too close for later XRT observations.|BAT: short hard burst
